We are so excited to welcome your child to Elite Dance & Music this year!
Our goal is simple: to create a positive, encouraging space where every dancer can build confidence and grow.
To help everything run smoothly, please review the following guidelines. After reading, please e-sign to let us know you understand and agree. And remember â€” if you ever have questions, just reach out. We are always happy to help!

Communication
Our main way of keeping in touch is email.  (Future SMS & Voice Messaging coming)
Please make sure we have your current email address so you receive updates, newsletters, payment reminders, and weather closings.
Check your email regularly to stay connected with whatâ€™s happening at the studio.

Tuition
Tuition is set based on an August to May dance season. It is the same every month, even if there are holidays or fewer classes.
Depending on recital dates, tuition may also be pro-rated for June.
The first month of tuition and the registration fee are due at enrollment.
If recital classes continue into June, your June tuition will be added to Mayâ€™s payment.

Registration Fee
$75 per child OR $105 per family, due at registration.
Covers administrative costs, insurance, and music fees.

Payment Policies
Tuition is due on the 1st of each month and late after the 10th.
Late payments will be charged a $10 fee.  Returned checks will be charged a $25 fee.
We accept cash, checks, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express.
Auto-pay is available for monthly tuition.
To stop auto-pay, a Stop Draft Form must be submitted by the 15th of the month.
Recital fees are not included in auto-pay.

Discounts
Pre-Pay Discount: 10% discount off remaining balance when paid in full for the season prior to November 1st or upon initial registration of a new student.   

Family Discount
The first child pays full tuition.
Each additional sibling receives $10 off their monthly tuition.
This discount applies to siblings only (not cousins).
Discounts are applied per student, not to the family total.

Example:
If tuition is $105/month:
First child: $105/month
Second child: $95/month
Third child: $95/month
Fourth child: $95/month
ðŸ‘‰ The sibling discount is always $10 off per child â€” it does not increase with more siblings.

Drop Policy
If you need to withdraw from a class, written notice is required 2 weeks in advance.
Tuition will continue to be charged until written notice is received.

Make-Up & Refund Policy
We do not issue refunds for missed classes.
If a student misses class, they may attend another class of the same level (if available).
Refunds are only given if the studio cancels a class and no make-up option is offered.
