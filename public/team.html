        Jason is one half of the leadership duo behind Elite Dance & Music. A visionary entrepreneur with a passion for helping people grow, he brings energy, creativity, and big-picture thinking to the studio. Whether he’s fine-tuning schedules, cheering on young dancers, or fixing something behind the scenes, Jason is all about building a space where kids thrive and families feel at home.
        <br><br>
        While dance might not be his go-to move (unless his daughters volunteer him), Jason is a firm believer in the power of the arts to shape confidence and character. When he’s not at the studio, you’ll likely find him working on hobbies, walking the dog, going to the gym, or spending quality time with his favorite people — his family.

From finances to operations to supporting the team, she’s the quiet force making sure the magic of dance happens without a hitch.
        <br><br>
        A lifelong lover of the arts and proud dance mom herself, Tashara knows how special the studio experience is for both kids and parents. She brings warmth, wisdom, and a steady hand to every part of the business — and does it all with grace (and usually a to-do list in hand).
        <br><br>
        When not at the studio, Tashara is most often found with her family, curled up with a good book, or organizing the next big adventure.

    <div class="bio-text" id="bio-lisa">
      <p class="text-gray-700">
        Lisa began dancing at the age of four with The Dorothy Frankovitch School of Theatrical Arts in Las Vegas, Nevada. By the age of ten, she was giving solo performances in pointe and flamenco dance. She competed for a short while with a traveling gymnastics team always doing well in the floor category due to her dance training.
        <br><br>
        At 12, Lisa began dancing at UNLV with The Nevada Dance Theater under Artistic Director Vasili Sulich where she danced with the youth company in NDT's performances of Hansel and Gretel and The Nutcracker. Later in high school, she was promoted to the corps de ballet for performances of Vivaldi’s Four Seasons and The Nutcracker. Lisa earned several dance scholarships in college where she was chosen for the elite song and dance troupe “Showtime Company.” They toured during the summers throughout the US and Canada performing in over 70 major cities including Chicago, New York, Montreal, and yes... Nashville.
        <br><br>
        It was in college that she added tap, modern, jazz, and clogging to her repertoire. She also began to compete in ballroom dance where she completed her silver medal training in both Latin and Smooth ballroom and took several 1st and 2nd place trophies competing against world-ranked BYU ballroom dance team members. While in college, Lisa began teaching ballet, tap, and jazz classes at the local dance studio and then taught ballroom, ballet, and jazz at The Dance Institute in Las Vegas during her summer breaks.
        <br><br>
        In 1984, Lisa married Rusel Hays and they created their seven wonderful children. During her 20-year career as a military wife, Lisa created dance programs on bases in Fairbanks, Alaska and for three years in South Korea. Ms. Lisa believes that every dancer should have a strong foundation in ballet and pulls her teaching style mainly from the Russian "Vaganova" school, but uses terminology from the more commonly found French and Cecchetti methods. “My main goal is to have a fun but well-disciplined class which teaches every child to be self-confident and to love dance.”
        <br><br>
        Besides teaching at Elite, Lisa is currently competing in Irish dance and gives private lessons in flute, piano, and harp. She and her husband created the Nashville Fencing Club and coach the fencing teams for multiple local high schools. For the past four years, she has taught hundreds of Ravenwood JROTC cadets formation ballroom routines for their annual Military Ball.
